# PayPal-JS Standard-Checkout-Sample

This code sample shows how to set up standard payments on your checkout page so your buyers can pay with PayPal, debit and credit cards, Pay Later options, Venmo, and alternative payment methods.This code sample uses the [JavaScript SDK](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/). The client-side sample code adds payment buttons to your website that capture the payment immediately. If you need to store the resulting transaction details in a database or want to fulfill orders automatically, use the included full-stack example code instead.

If you want to create this app from scratch, follow the [standard checkout integrartion](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/standard/integrate/) guide from the [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/home) docs.

## Run this App
Before you run this app, you need to add you client-id to the script tag.
Replace **YOUR-CLIENT-ID-CREDENTIALS** in the SDK <script src> with your own sandbox client ID from one of your [REST apps](https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.paypal.com%2Fdeveloper%2Fapplications%2F&_ga=1.84996752.841672670.1664266268). This ensures the payments will be sent to the correct account. Note which sandbox Business account corresponds to the REST app you are using.
Just open the `index.html` file and you should see the following buttons.
